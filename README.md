# weather-app

For this project, I created a weather app where a user can input the name of a city and the page displays the current weather and future weather for that location.  I needed to fetch data from Open Weather Map by creating parameters that examine the latitude and longitude of each location and then provide specific data back, based on other set parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index.  I also needed to assign icons, representing the various weather conditions, to variables so that there would be a visual representation of the weather conditions in the final display.
